### Blending Techniques

**Color Blending:**

**Typography Blending:**
- Primary style dictates font families
- Secondary influences hierarchy/sizing
- Accent for display/hero moments

**Component Blending:**
- Primary defines component structure
- Secondary influences surface treatments
- Accent for micro-interactions

**Layout Blending:**
- Primary establishes grid system
- Secondary affects spacing/density
- Accent for featured sections
