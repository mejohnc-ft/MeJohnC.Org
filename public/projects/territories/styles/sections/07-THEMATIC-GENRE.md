# Section 7: Thematic/Genre

## Focus

This section contains design styles tied to **specific themes, places, or genre conventions**. These are aesthetics defined by their subject matter rather than historical period or design movement. They provide complete visual worlds for products serving niche audiences or themed experiences.

These styles are powerful for creating immersive, targeted experiences but have limited application outside their specific contexts.

## Avoiding Theme Fatigue

Themed styles can feel overwhelming. Best practices:

|----------|---------------|
| Thematic header, neutral content | Theme in hero, clean body |
| Color palette only | Extract colors, skip decoration |
| Iconography hints | Themed icons, standard layouts |
| Progressive revelation | Theme increases as users go deeper |
| Mode switching | Allow users to reduce theme intensity |
