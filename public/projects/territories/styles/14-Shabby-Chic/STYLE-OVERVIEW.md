## Design Philosophy

### Core Principles

**Beauty in Imperfection**
Wear, age, and patina tell stories more interesting than newness.

**Romantic Nostalgia**
Connect emotionally through references to gentler, more elegant times.

**Feminine Without Fussy**
Soft beauty that feels effortless, not overdone.

**Curated Vintage**
Each piece should feel discovered and treasured.

### Influences

- French provincial style
- English cottage gardens
- Victorian romanticism
- 1950s domestic aesthetics

- Marie Antoinette pastoral fantasy
