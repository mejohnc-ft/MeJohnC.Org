# Ethereal Design Style

## Visual Characteristics

- **Light Pastel Palettes**: Soft pinks, lavenders, mint, and cream
- **Gauzy Overlays**: Translucent layers suggesting mist or fabric
- **Minimal Contrast**: Deliberately low contrast for dreamy effect
- **Delicate Typography**: Thin serifs and light sans-serifs
- **Feathered Shadows**: Soft, diffused shadows without hard edges
- **Abundant White Space**: Breathing room suggesting openness
- **Subtle Textures**: Watercolor washes, soft grain, paper texture
- **Flowing, Organic Shapes**: Gentle curves, no sharp angles

## Why This Works for AI

Ethereal style is well-suited for AI generation because:

- **Soft Focus Forgiveness**: Blur and diffusion hide imperfections
- **Abstract Interpretation**: No need for precise realism
- **Mood-First Approach**: Atmosphere matters more than detail
- **Consistent Aesthetic**: Clear visual rules produce reliable results

**Effective Prompt Modifiers**: "ethereal," "dreamy," "soft focus," "gauzy," "weightless," "misty," "delicate," "otherworldly"

## Design Philosophy

### Core Principles

**Lightness of Being**
Design should feel weightless, as if it might float away.

**Suggestion Over Statement**
Imply rather than declare. Leave room for imagination.

**Serenity First**
Every element should contribute to a sense of calm and peace.

**Beauty in Simplicity**
Complexity is unnecessary when atmosphere carries meaning.

### Influences

- Pre-Raphaelite painting
- Japanese mono no aware (beauty in impermanence)
- Soft-focus photography
- Romantic poetry and literature
- Meditation and mindfulness practices

## Typography System

### Recommended Typefaces

| Role | Font | Weight | Size |
|------|------|--------|------|
| Display | Cormorant | 300 | 48-72px |

| Body | Source Serif Pro | 300-400 | 16-17px |
| Caption | Karla | 300 | 12-14px |

### Typography Guidelines

- **Weight**: Light weights exclusively (300-400)
- **Letter-spacing**: Expanded (+3-5%) for airiness
- **Line-height**: Very generous (1.7-2.0)
- **Color**: Muted tones, never pure black or pure white
- **Effects**: Minimal; let delicacy of letterforms speak

## UX Patterns

### Breathing Layouts

**Pattern**: Extreme white space creates meditative pacing

**Implementation**:
- Generous margins (80-120px on desktop)
- Single-column layouts for focus
- Section spacing of 120-200px
- Content density deliberately low

**Best Practice**: Every element needs "room to breathe"

### Soft Transitions

**Pattern**: All state changes use gentle, slow animations

**Implementation**:
- Transition durations of 400-600ms
- Ease-out timing functions
- Opacity fades rather than abrupt changes
- Elements fade in as they scroll into view

**Best Practice**: Never jarring; always calming

### Minimal Navigation

**Pattern**: Navigation is understated, almost hidden

**Implementation**:
- Text-only navigation in muted colors
- Hamburger menus even on desktop
- No bold navigation states
- Subtle underlines on hover

**Best Practice**: Navigation should not compete with content

### Image Treatment

**Pattern**: Photos receive soft, dreamy processing

**Implementation**:
- Reduced contrast and saturation
- Soft vignettes
- Slight blur or grain overlay
- Gentle color tinting

**Best Practice**: Consistency across all imagery
