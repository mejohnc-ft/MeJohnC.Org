# Bohemian Design Style

## Visual Characteristics

- **Eclectic Layering**: Mixed patterns, textures, and cultural influences
- **Rich Earth Tones**: Terracotta, ochre, deep jewel tones, natural browns
- **Ethnic and Global Patterns**: Kilim, ikat, mandala, tribal motifs
- **Natural Textures**: Woven fabrics, macrame, rattan, raw wood
- **Handcrafted Feel**: Imperfect, artisanal aesthetic
- **Maximalist but Warm**: Abundance that feels collected, not cluttered

- **Eclectic Flexibility**: Style allows for creative interpretation

**Effective Prompt Modifiers**: "bohemian," "boho chic," "global eclectic," "moroccan patterns," "wanderlust aesthetic," "artisan handmade," "ethnic textiles"
