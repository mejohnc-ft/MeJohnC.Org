# Developer-Native / Terminal Aesthetic

## Overview
This design territory **respects technical users** by speaking their visual language. It embraces the command line, code blocks, and step-by-step precision. The aesthetic signals "this is for builders" and creates immediate trust with developers who are often skeptical of polished marketing.

## Visual Characteristics

- **Monospace typography throughout** — Code-like appearance even in UI
- **Terminal/code block styling** — Syntax highlighting, command prompts
- **Step-by-step numbered workflows** — Clear progression, nothing hidden
- **Minimal chrome** — Maximum content, minimum decoration
- **Green on black** — Classic terminal palette, signals "active"
- **Pixel iconography** — Retro-tech aesthetic, dithered graphics

## Key Design Vocabulary

| Term | Meaning |
|------|---------|
| **Developer Experience (DX)** | The quality of a developer's interaction with tools |
| **Zero-Friction Onboarding** | Clear steps, copy-paste ready, no guessing |
| **Trust through Transparency** | Showing exactly what commands will run |
| **Command-Line Aesthetic** | Visual language that power users recognize instantly |
| **Copy-to-Clipboard** | Every code block should be one click to copy |
| **Progressive Complexity** | Start simple, reveal advanced options on demand |

## Why This Works for AI Products

- **Builds developer trust** — "They understand how I work"
- **Reduces onboarding friction** — Clear steps, no ambiguity
- **Signals technical depth** — Product is serious, not toy
- **Self-documenting UI** — The interface teaches itself

## Typography Recommendations

| Use | Font | Size |
|-----|------|------|
| **Code blocks** | JetBrains Mono, Berkeley Mono, Fira Code | 14px |
| **UI Labels** | Inter, SF Mono, Geist Mono | 13px |
| **Headlines** | Inter Semibold, Geist | 24-32px |
| **Step numbers** | Tabular figures, circled or boxed | 14px |

## Code Block Styling

```
Background:    #1a1a1a or #0d0d0d
Border:        1px solid #333 or subtle glow
Prompt:        $ in muted gray (#666)
Commands:      White or light gray (#e0e0e0)
Flags:         Syntax highlighted (cyan, green)
Comments:      Muted (#666)
Copy button:   Top-right, appears on hover
```

## Form Design Principles

- **Labels above inputs** — Scan pattern, not side-by-side
- **Helpful microcopy** — "A display name for this agent. Shown in the dashboard."
- **Sensible defaults** — Pre-filled where possible
- **Prominent primary CTA** — Green "Create Agent" button stands out
- **Optional fields marked** — Don't require what you don't need

## Interaction Patterns

| Pattern | Implementation |
|---------|----------------|
| **Numbered steps** | Circled numbers (1, 2, 3) with clear progression |
| **Terminal simulation** | Actual working code blocks, not screenshots |
| **Status indicators** | Green dots = running, checkmarks = complete |
| **Error states** | Red highlight with actionable message |
| **Success states** | Green confirmation, next step suggestion |
