# Bold Information / Swiss Poster Style

## Overview
This design territory prioritizes **clarity and impact** above all else. Rooted in Swiss/International Typographic Style, it uses bold color, strong typography, and geometric simplicity to communicate information quickly and memorably. Each card or section functions like a **mini-poster** that can stand alone.

## Visual Characteristics

- **Strong duotone/monotone color schemes** — One dominant color per card/section
- **High contrast typography** — Large, bold headlines against solid backgrounds
- **Geometric illustrations** — Circles, triangles, lines as abstract representations
- **Scanline/overlay effects** — Adds texture and visual interest to photography
- **Card-based modular layouts** — Each unit is self-contained
- **Minimal decoration** — Nothing that doesn't communicate
