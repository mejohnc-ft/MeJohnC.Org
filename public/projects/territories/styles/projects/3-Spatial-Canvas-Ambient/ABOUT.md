# Spatial Canvas / Ambient Intelligence

## Overview
This design territory creates **transparency and trust** by showing users the system working. It's ideal for **multi-agent AI, orchestration platforms, and complex workflows** where users need to understand relationships and real-time state. The UI becomes a living, breathing visualization of intelligence at work.

## Visual Characteristics

- **Dark infinite canvas** — Elements float in space, suggesting depth and possibility
- **Node-and-edge visualizations** — Agents as nodes, connections as relationships
- **Particle effects and subtle animations** — System feels alive, not static
- **Glassmorphism cards** — Floating panels with blur and transparency
- **Activity feeds as persistent sidebars** — Ambient awareness without interruption
- **Green accent color** — Universally signals "active," "AI," or "connected"

## Key Design Vocabulary

| Term | Meaning |
|------|---------|
| **Spatial UI** | Elements exist in navigable space, not just stacked pages |
| **Ambient Awareness** | Seeing system state at a glance without active querying |
| **Progressive Disclosure** | Overview first, details on demand (click to expand) |
| **Living System** | UI that shows the system is alive and actively working |
| **Node Graph** | Visual representation of connected entities and relationships |
| **Real-time Streaming** | Data that updates continuously, not on refresh |

## Why This Works for AI Products

- **Builds trust** — Users see what the AI is doing, not just results
- **Reduces anxiety** — "Is it working?" is answered visually
- **Handles complexity** — Multi-agent systems become comprehensible
- **Creates engagement** — Watching the system work is almost meditative

## Interaction Patterns

| Pattern | Use Case |
|---------|----------|
| **Canvas pan/zoom** | Exploring large agent networks |
| **Hover to reveal** | Quick details without losing context |
| **Click to focus** | Zoom into a specific agent/node |
| **Sidebar persistence** | Activity feed always visible |
| **Floating action buttons** | Quick actions without navigation |

## Animation Principles

- **Ease-out curves** — Elements arrive quickly, settle slowly (feels natural)
- **Staggered entry** — Multiple items appear in sequence, not all at once
- **Subtle pulse** — Active nodes breathe slowly to indicate life
- **Connection lines animate** — Data flow is visualized in real-time
- **Particle drift** — Background particles suggest ambient intelligence

## Typography Recommendations

- **System labels:** Small caps, monospace, muted colors
- **Node names:** Medium weight sans-serif, high contrast
- **Activity feed:** Compact, timestamp-forward, icon-led
- **Stats:** Large, bold numerics with trend indicators
