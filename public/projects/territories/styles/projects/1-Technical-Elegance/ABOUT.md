# Technical Elegance / Data-Forward Design

## Overview
This design territory communicates **sophistication and technical depth** while remaining approachable. It's the language of modern B2B SaaS, AI platforms, and data products that need to feel intelligent without being intimidating.

## Visual Characteristics

- **Blueprint/schematic aesthetic** — Circuit-inspired linework, node diagrams
- **Bold color blocking** — Typically 3-4 colors maximum, used semantically
- **Dark mode as primary canvas** — Data and content "glow" against the background
- **Geometric abstractions** — Circles, lines, triangles representing AI/data concepts
- **Clean sans-serif typography** — Often paired with monospace for data/stats
