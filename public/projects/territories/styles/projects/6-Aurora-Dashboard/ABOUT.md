# Aurora Dashboard Reference

## Overview
This folder contains **design reference work** — the Aurora Dashboard pattern. These screenshots represent a distinctive design direction for AI-powered enterprise dashboards and serve as a reference style within the Typeset Design System Explorer.

## Files in This Folder

| File | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `Untitled.jpg` | **Coming Soon / Vision** — Roadmap with Knowledge, Pulse, Align, AI Teammate |
| `Untitled 2.jpg` | **Built & Ready** — Three platforms with progress bars, embedded screenshots |
| `Untitled 3.jpg` | **Critical Insights** — Big stat cards (+35.8%, +155%), recommendations list |
| `Untitled 4.jpg` | **Workflow Performance** — Data table with categories, trends, status tags |
| `Untitled 5.jpg` | **Performance Charts** — Line graph, donut chart, bar comparison |
| `Untitled 6.jpg` | **Coming Soon / Vision** — (duplicate of roadmap view) |
| `Untitled 7.jpg` | **Success Report Hero** — Large headline, stat cards, gradient header |

## What's Working Well

| Strength | Where It Shows |
|----------|----------------|
| **Clear information hierarchy** | Hero stats (292.5h, 139.8h) are unmissable |
| **Semantic color system** | Green = growth, Orange = action/active, Purple = AI |
| **Card-based modularity** | Each section is self-contained, scannable |
| **Gradient header** | Creates visual "sky" that elevates the content |
| **Progress visualization** | Bars, percentages, trend arrows communicate status |
| **Roadmap storytelling** | "Coming Soon" section creates anticipation |
| **Consistent navigation** | Tab bar (Overview, Performance, Workflows, etc.) is clear |
| **Status badges** | READY, BETA, ACTIVE tags provide quick context |

## Opportunities to Elevate

| Area | Current State | Potential Enhancement |
|------|---------------|----------------------|
| **Typography** | Clean but uniform | Add display font for hero moments ("SUCCESS REPORT") |
| **Motion** | Static | Add micro-animations for stat counters, progress bars |
| **Spatial elements** | Flat cards | Could the Vision flow be more node-based/spatial? |
| **Data viz** | Standard charts | Custom chart styling to match brand |
| **Icons** | Functional | Consider custom icon set for product identity |
| **Empty states** | Not shown | Design delightful empty/loading states |
| **Dark mode depth** | Single level | Add subtle gradients, glassmorphism for layering |

## Design System Components Identified

From your current work, you have these UI patterns established:

### Cards
- **Stat Card** — Large number, label, trend badge
- **Feature Card** — Icon, title, description, status badge, progress bar
- **Insight Card** — Big percentage, category, supporting text

### Navigation
- **Top bar** — Logo, tabs, Present button, settings
- **Tab system** — Overview, Performance, Workflows, Insights, Innovation

### Data Display
- **Data table** — Workflow, Category tag, numeric columns, trend badge
- **Progress bar** — Percentage label, colored fill
- **Trend indicators** — Arrows with percentages, color-coded

### Typography Scale (observed)
```
Hero headline:     ~80px bold condensed (SUCCESS REPORT)
Section title:     ~48px italic (Coming Soon, Built & Ready)
Card title:        ~24px semibold
Card description:  ~16px regular
Stat number:       ~64px bold
Stat label:        ~14px caps
```

## Color Palette (extracted)

```
Background:        #0a0a0a to #1a1a1a (dark gradient)
Header gradient:   Blue-green-purple aurora effect
Primary green:     #4ADE80 (growth, CTAs)
Orange accent:     #FB923C (active, attention)
Blue accent:       #60A5FA (information, links)
Purple accent:     #A78BFA (AI, innovation)
Red accent:        #EF4444 (declining, alerts)
Text primary:      #FFFFFF
Text secondary:    #9CA3AF
Card background:   #1F2937 or transparent with border
```

## Recommendations for Next Iteration

1. **Add a display typeface** — Consider Fraunces, Instrument Serif, or custom for headlines
2. **Introduce motion** — Stat counters that animate up, progress bars that fill
3. **Deepen the hierarchy** — Use glassmorphism for floating elements
4. **Custom iconography** — Design icons that match your brand personality
5. **Micro-interactions** — Hover states, button feedback, transitions
6. **Consider spatial layout** — The Vision flow could be a node diagram
