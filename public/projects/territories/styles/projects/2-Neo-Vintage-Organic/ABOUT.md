# Neo-Vintage / Organic Modernism

## Overview
This design territory creates **emotional resonance and warmth** by blending digital interfaces with tactile, handcrafted aesthetics. It counters the "cold robot" perception of AI with humanity and craft. Excellent for consumer-facing AI products that need to feel approachable.

## Visual Characteristics

- **Stamp/postcard metaphors** — Perforated edges, numbered sequences
- **Monochromatic or earth-tone palettes** — Greens, creams, soft pastels
- **Hand-crafted illustration styles** — Woodblock prints, watercolor, anime, vintage travel posters
- **Generous white/cream space** — Breathing room, not cramped
- **Serif + sans-serif pairing** — Classic headlines with modern body text
- **Numbered sequences** — 01, 02, 03 creating a sense of journey/collection
